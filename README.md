# Nacho Mama's Quiz

The vision:

The goal of this application is fun!

Learn new facts, score points for your knowledge.

As you answer correctly you will watch your score climb. Answer incorrectly and get insulted.

Be cheered, be jeered.

We're good sports, but if you get answers wrong, we're going to let you know in a fun, tasteless way with random insults.

Log your high scores and beat them!
